# What is it?
The windF12 is an F-row for people that use a 60% keyboard or play Minecraft on a MacBook like me.
It's main purpose is to provide the F keys to the user (duh).
It can be used wired or wirelessly depending on what Seeed Xiao you pick.
For wired (or ambitious wireless) users you can also add SK6812MINI-E leds under the keys for cool lighting effects.
